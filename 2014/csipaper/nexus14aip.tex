\begin{abstract}
NeXus is an effort by an international group of scientists to define 
 a common data exchange format for neutron, muon and x-ray experiments.   
NeXus is built on top of the scientific data format HDF5 and adds domain 
specific rules for organizing data within HDF5 files as well as a dictionary of well 
defined domain-specific field names. The NeXus data format has two purposes.  First, NeXus defines a
format that can serve as a container for all relevant data associated
with a beamline, an increasingly important function.  Second, NeXus
defines standards in the form of \emph{application definitions} for the
exchange of data between applications.  NeXus provides structures for raw experimental data as well as for processed data.

\section{Introduction}
Increasingly, major neutron and x-ray facilities choose to store their data in the NeXus data format. 
Since 2006, NeXus\cite{nxold} has undergone substantial refocusing, 
refinement and enhancement as described in this paper.  

Historically, neutron and x-ray facilities choose to store their data in a plethora of 
home-grown data formats. This scheme has a number of drawbacks addressed by NeXus: 
\begin{itemize}
\item It makes the life of traveling scientists unnecessarily difficult as they have to deal with multiple files 
 in different formats, file converters and such in order to extract scientific information from the data.
 \item An unnecessary burden is imposed on data analysis software producers as they have to accommodate so many different formats.  
\item The whole idea of open access to data is sabotaged if the data is in a format which cannot be easily understood.
\item Modern high speed detectors produce data at such a rate that many older single image storage schemes become impractical and 
 an efficient container format is a necessity. 
\end{itemize}

The first necessity for a data format is a physical file format: how is the data written to disk? Rather than inventing  
yet another format, NeXus chose HDF5\cite{hdf5} as the binary container format. HDF5 is efficient, self describing, 
platform independent, in the public domain and well supported by both commercial and free software tools. 

NeXus adds to HDF5:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rules for organizing domain-specific data within a HDF5 file
\item A dictionary of documented domain-specific field names
\item Definitions of standards that can be validated
\end{itemize}

The development of NeXus is overseen by a committee, the NeXus International Advisory Committee (NIAC).

\section{NeXus Design Principles}

The authors of data-acquisition and instrument-control software are encouraged to generate exactly \emph{one} NeXus container file per measurement
(a measurement is either a data accumulation under fixed conditions,
or a scan).
This file includes not only the detector and monitor data,
but also metadata, information on the state of the beamline, parameter logs, and more.
Authors of data-reduction and data-analysis software can use NeXus to
store processed data along with metadata and a processing log.

As a container format, NeXus allows files to be extended at any moment by
additional entries.
A special field type, NXcollection, exempts its contents from validation
and thereby allows inclusion of whatever data in arbitrary non-NeXus formats.

A NeXus container file may contain hundreds of fields. Often, all that is needed for data reduction or analysis are a small fraction 
of these - perhaps fewer than 20 fields. These necessary fields are dependent on the experimental technique and NeXus provides a way to 
describe a set of necessary fields as a NeXus application definition. Files can be validated against such an application definition
by checking for the presence of the required fields. This is the way in which NeXus expresses file standards. 

\section{NeXus File Hierarchies}
NeXus data files are organized into a hierarchy of groups which, in turn, can contain further groups or fields, 
very much like an internal file system. For an overview of the NeXus data file structure for raw experimental data see Table \ref{rawfile}.
\begin{table}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In the following sections, we will describe some of the rules that define the overall structure of NeXus files. Many fine details 
of the NeXus format have been thoroughly discussed and are now well defined, but for the sake of brevity, we will not present an 
exhaustive view of NeXus here. A full listing of NeXus rules are given in the NeXus manual\cite{nxman}. Some examples of these 
additional rules include those governing:
\begin{itemize}
\item How axes are associated with data
\item That units must be given with the data
\item How data is to be stored in NeXus fields
\item How to describe array data which is not in ANSI C storage order
\end{itemize}



\subsection{NeXus Raw Data File Hierarchy}
The major focus of NeXus has been the recording of ``raw'' experimental data, i.e. information taken directly from the experimental 
equipment, or processed only as required to provide physically meaningful values.
The NeXus raw data file hierarchy is the consequence of some practical considerations. When looking at a beamline it is easy to 
discern different components: beam optic components, sample position, detectors and such. It is quite natural to mirror this physical 
separation with a logical arrangement of storing the data from each component in a separate group. This approach explains the 
list of beamline components in the NXinstrument group presented in Table\ref{rawfile}. 
As there can be multiple instances of the same kind of equipment, like slits or detectors, in a given beamline it becomes necessary
to add type information to the group name,
which is provided by a HDF5 attribute, the NeXus class name.
By convention NeXus class names start 
with the prefix NX. Each NeXus group describing a beamline component contains further groups and fields describing the component. 
A field can contain a single number, a text string or an array, as appropriate to the data to be described.  

The requirement to store multiple related scans or runs  in the same file or to capture 
a complete workflow in a file causes the beamline component hierarchy to be pushed one level deeper into an NXentry 
group in the hierarchy. The NXentry  group thus represents one scan or run (or a processed data entry, as will be discussed later). 
The NXentry group also holds the experiment metadata, such as the date and time at which it was performed. 

The requirement to access sample information and counting information such as monitors quickly 
pulled this information out of the beamline hierarchy and into the NXentry level.

Another requirement was to provide easy access to a default visualization of the data. This idea was realised with the 
NXdata type group at NXentry level. The NXdata group contains the data and axes data necessary to create a default plot of 
the data in the entry. This is data which will typically live in the NXdetector or other groups in the 
beamline component list. HDF5 links are used to avoid duplicating data. A link 
is a pointer to data sitting at another place in the file hierarchy, like a symbolic link in a unix 
file system.  The NXdata group is intended to hold such links to the relevant pieces of information.

\subsubsection{Multiple Method Instruments}

Particularly at X-ray sources, some beamlines implement multiple techniques in the same instrument. 
For example small-angle scattering (SAS) and powder diffraction in the same beamline are sometimes measured 
simultaneously (such as SAXS/WAXS). This poses a problem for an automatic data analysis tool to find its data 
for processing.  NeXus solves this problem through a scheme involving these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item All the data is stored in one NXentry hierarchy
\item At entry level, for each experimental method of the beamline an NXsubentry group is introduced. The 
  NXsubentry groups have the same hierarchy as the  NXentry group. NXsubentry holds only the data relevant 
  for the experimental method it describes. In order to avoid data duplication, links into the main NXentry 
  hierarchy are used. 
  NXsubentry usually only holds the 20-30 data items required by its corresponding NeXus 
  application definition.  
\end{enumerate} 
These steps are represented in the overview of Table \ref{multimethod}.

\begin{table}
\caption{Overview of the structure of a NeXus raw data file for an instrument with multiple methods \label{multimethod}}

\end{tabular}\\
\end{tabular}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Scans}

Scans come in all shapes and sizes. Almost anything can be scanned against anything. 
An additional difficulty is that in practice, the number of scan points in the scan 
cannot be known in advance since it is possible that a scan may be interrupted or terminated
before its planned number of observations. 
Thus, it is a challenge to standardize a scan.
NeXus solves these difficulties through 
a couple of conventions and the use of a HDF5 feature called unlimited dimensions. With the HDF5 
unlimited dimensions feature, one axis of the data is allowed to expand without limit and 
the size of a data array does not need to be declared in advance. Data can be appended 
to an array along the unlimited dimension as required. 

Scans are stored in NeXus following these conventions: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Each variable varied or collected in the scan is stored at its appropriate place in the NeXus beamline 
 hierarchy as an array. The array's first dimension is the scan axis. This is the unlimited dimension in 
 the implementation and data is appended at each scan point to the array. 
\item The NXdata group holds links to all the variables varied or collected during the scan. 
 This creates something equivalent or better than the tabular representation people are used to for scans. 
 The main detector data scan be plotted against any scanned parameter as well as against everything that was 
 deemed worth recording in addition to that, reading the NXdata group alone. 
\end{itemize}

NeXus allows multi dimensional scans too. This makes it very simple to produce meaningful slices through data 
volmes even with NeXus-agnostic software (like hdfview). Interrupting a multi-dimensional scan may, depending 
on the software used, leave some of the data in an uninitialised state (usually the HDF5 fill value). 
This behaviour is currently undefined in NeXus.

\subsubsection{Coordinate System and Positioning of Components}

For analysing data it is often necessary to know the exact position and orientation of beamline components. 
The first thing needed is a reference coordinate system. NeXus chose to use same coordinate system as the 
neutron beamline simulation software McStas\cite{mcstas}. 

For describing the placement and orientation of components, NeXus stores the same information as used for the 
same purpose in the Crystallographic Interchange Format (CIF)\cite{ITCVG}. CIF (and NeXus) stores the details 
of the translations and rotations necessary to move a given component from the zero point of the coordinate 
system to its actual position. As coordinate transformations are not commutative, the order of transformations 
must also be stored.

\multicolumn{2}{p{3.0cm}}{The result data from the data processing including its axes}\\
\end{tabular}\\
\end{tabular}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Processed Data}

At the request of the user community, NeXus created a simplified structure for storing the result of data 
processing: be it reduction or analysis. In many cases even the reduced data is big enough to need 
an efficient binary representation. A good example is a tomography reconstruction. A tabular representation 
of the NeXus processed data file structure is given in Table \ref{procfile}. 

The hierarchy is much reduced as it is not important to carry all experimental information in the data 
reduction. In contrast to the raw data file structure, NXdata in the processed file structure is the place 
to store the results of the processing, together with its associated axes if the result is a multi-dimensional array.   
 
Information about the sample and instrument can be stored in NXsample and NXinstrument groups as required. 

In addition, there is a new structure to store details about the processing such as the program used, its version, 
the date of processing, and other metadata 
in the NXprocess group. The NXprocess group can hold additional NXparameter groups which are containers 
for storing the input and output parameters of the program used to perform the processing. 


\section{The NeXus Dictionary}

As can be seen from the discussion of the NeXus file hierarchy, NeXus arranges data into groups which have a 
type descriptor, the NeXus base class, associated with them. For each of these NeXus base classes, there 
exists a description of all the fields and groups allowed within such a NeXus base class as well as definitions 
of the scientific meaning of each field. The collection of these NeXus base classes constitute the NeXus dictionary. 
The term class is a little misleading: NeXus base classes are not classes in strict object oriented notation, but 
are dictionaries of allowed group and field keywords. A common misconception is that NeXus users have to give values for all the allowed keywords.
This is not the case; only those applicable to the instrument and situation at hand need to be written to the file.

The NeXus base classes are encoded in NeXus Description Language (NXDL)\cite{nxman}. NXDL is 
just another application of XML. Thus a NXDL file is an XML file that specifies the content of the NeXus base classes. 

Procedures are in place to extend NeXus base classes quickly when necessary.


\section{NeXus Application Definitions}

The NeXus approach to standardization is unique for a standard. At first NeXus asks you to store 
as much relevant information about your data as possible. In a second step NeXus then defines a 
standard for a certain use case of NeXus, an application definition, wherein domain-specific fields 
for that use case are described as well as their locations within the NeXus file.
Use cases can be experimental techniques like SAS or 
powder diffraction, while processed data use cases such as tomography reconstructions or $S(Q,\omega)$, 
or even administrative use cases such as archiving. This scheme works because data in a NeXus file 
can be searched for. Thus it is trivial to ignore data which is not of interest for a particular use case.

Another way to look at a NeXus application definition is as a contract between file writers and file consumers 
about the minimum content of the file necessary to fulfill that particular use case as well as a map of where the 
data should be located and its format.

NeXus application definitions are expressed in NXDL.  They may be parsed either by humans or by software and 
they may be validated for syntax and content.  The NXDL files are used to validate the structure of
NeXus data files. A tool exists to perform such validation.%
% TODO: can we please add some kind of reference to where the validation tool can be found?
% JAVA source code is here:
% https://github.com/nexusformat/code/tree/master/applications/NXvalidate
% is there a JAR file available?

A great number of candidate NeXus application definitions exist which were derived from our understanding 
of the technique described. For each of these, the NeXus team seeks community approval. 
Currently scientists 
from NeXus and the IUCr are nearly finished with a NeXus application definition for macromolecular crystallography.
CBFlib\cite{cbflib} is being extended to work with NeXus-MX format. This work will be published in another paper. 
Work on another NeXus application definition for reduced small-angle scattering data
is also in progress\cite{cansas}  by members of 
canSAS, NeXus, and the IUCr Commission on Small-Angle Scattering.


\section{Uptake of NeXus} 

NeXus is already in use as the main data format at facilities like Soleil, Diamond, SINQ, SNS, Lujan/LANL 
and KEK. Other facilities like ISIS, DESY and the muSR community are in the process of moving towards 
NeXus as  data format. At LBNL, NeXus is currently being adapted for XFEL serial crystallographic data. 


The adoption of NeXus took time. The reason is that NeXus is often chosen whenever 
a facility starts operation or undergoes major refurbishments. For those facilities where there is an existing and working 
pipeline from data acquisition to data analysis,  the resources are usually lacking to move 
towards NeXus.

This is reflected in the experience of the muon community. For the ISIS source, the move to a Windows PC-based data acquisition 
system in 2002 required a new data format, providing an ideal opportunity to exploit the emerging NeXus standard\cite{muon1}. In 
contrast, sources at PSI, TRIUMF and KEK continued to make good use of existing formats and software. More recently, funding 
from the EU has enabled the community to develop the Application Definition as a common exchange format for muon data\cite{muon2}. 
Whether used as the main or an intermediate format, users will soon be able to produce compatible NeXus files for data written 
across all facilities, enhancing the uptake of NeXus within the community.

\section{NeXus Governance}

The development of NeXus is overseen by the NeXus International Advisory Committee (NIAC).
In the NIAC, most major neutron, X-ray, and muon facilities are represented.
Other facilities are invited to join.

\section{Backwards Compatibility}

In the past, NeXus supported data files in HDF-4, HDF5, and XML file formats. 
To support writing software to write and read these file formats, the NeXus
application/programmer interface (NeXus-API) was provided.
This API is maintained at a bug fix level.
On request of the community, we now concentrate our efforts only
on the HDF5 files and tools.

\section{Summary}

NeXus has matured considerably over the last 10 years and is now in use in many facilities. NeXus 
is flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of instruments and scientific applications. 
Yet it is efficient enough to 
handle the data coming from modern high speed detectors.
