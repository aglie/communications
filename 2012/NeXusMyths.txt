NeXus Myths and Legends

For more than a decade, NeXus has been actively exploring philosophies and methods for 
recording scientific data, as well as testing and developing enabling technologies. 
Over this time, NeXus has evolved from a diverse and conflicting set of individual 
requirements and opinions into a unified set of principles that is flexible and 
inclusive. However, the image of NeXus has not always kept up with this maturation 
and outdated information persists in some corners of the scientific community. 

Below is a set of clarifying statements about NeXus:

* NeXus is inclusive. We want to collaborate with everybody in the scientific community 
  to develop standards that work well simultaneously for every individual and entire 
  communities.
* NeXus is being used by a significant number of instruments in numerous facilities.
* NeXus does not require you to store "lots of useless information". NeXus standards 
  are written by scientific communities for their own consumption. If something is 
  required in a NeXus application definition, then someone in your community has a 
  need for it. NeXus provides recommendations based on more than a decade of experience, 
  but each community of users is free to ignore them (at their own peril) so long as 
  they agree on something that can be validated. 
* NeXus standards are real and defined. NeXus provides tools to formally define the 
  standard for each community and validation tools to test compliance.
* NeXus does not have to be written in binary. NeXus is designed with the ability to 
  be expressed in multiple different physical file formats and tools are available 
  to convert between them.
