NeXus Code Camp 2012 Topics
================================

* PyTree API Tests,                        Eugen,
* NXdict replacement design,                low
* Automatisation and documentation of NeXus release process, 90% high

  * Implement continuous integration?
  * Write more tests?
  * Integrate sphinx into CMake build process?

* Change of documentation from docbook to sphinx,       medium
* Discuss timed data                                    deferred
* Preparing NIAC?                                       tomorrow, full 
* Fix trac tickets

 Done
==============
* Decision on CMake versus autoconf, The winner is CMake!
* Closed a lot of NAPI tickets
* Cleanup definitions trac tickets
* Finalize CIF coordinate issue,           high, tomorrow, full
* DECTRIS                                               high, little, fu
* Multi Dimensional Axes                                high, full
* Cleanup NeXus Applications,              quick, middle, full
  
  * Drop: nx2dtd, NXdump, NXformat_dfn
  * NXsummary, NXdir, nxtravers have similar tasks, which one?
                              


NIAC
=======
* Develop a materials definition    niac, strings plus enums                  
* Anyone still using F77?
* Anyone using NXcharacterization? Otherwise we remove it?
* ARPES Definition, contributed, review and decide next time
* CIF issue

  * depends_on attribute
  * offset attribute
  * offset_unit 
  * SDS: depends_on: starting point of depends_on chain
  * make vector attribute mandatory
  * This gives us CIF endorsement!
  * Implict requirements for scan: in chain all shapes are 
    either 1 or identical

* DECTRIS

  * Ask for a tool to recompress their data into a standard HDF-5 way. 
    Otherwise there may be long term maintenance issues.

Feedback 
================

* Users do not see benefits of NeXus
* Slow I/O
* When no need: why change data format?
* Why use NeXus when plain HDF-5 gives more performance?
* CIF and tiff as a barrier
* Camera specific formats

NeXus Usage
===================

* Soleil: 20 out of 26 instruments do NeXus, 2 Mill Files
* PSI-SINQ: 11 from 16 instrument son NeXus
* PSI-SLS: 0, 2 planned, 
* SLS: none yet, planning to 
* KEK: 10, 6 planned
* ANSTO: 7 going to 10
* ESRF: 2 beamlines, limited to NXentry, NXcollection, NXdata, moving to 4
* HZB: 3N, 3 planned 
* FRM 2: 0, moving to 1
* 

Tasks
================

* Need to find something only NeXus can do
* ESRF would like a simpler NeXus: NeXus ultralight or NXexchange
* ESRF: NIAC as a custodian
* Collect examples
* Work better with SW groups at facilities in construction
* Work for reduced data interchange
* Provide NeXus tools as components to be integrated into other SW



Axis 
==============

* Multi dimensional
* Requirements 

  * Which array defines the axis of the dataset
  * Allow alternative axis 
  * An axis may be a multidimensional dataset in order to allow for 
    read, non theoretical values. You must be able to figure out which 
    axis it maps.
  * Encoding this in attributes is a problem when 
    reusing the dataset in another context
  * Allow multiple plotable datasets in a group
