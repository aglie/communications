Done 
============
* CIF coordinates, tech committee suggestion accepted
* Quo Vadis, results below
* Nexus-developers merged into NeXus list
* Herbert Bernstein accepted as representative of 
  imageCIF
* NXcharacterization: mailing list, then kill
* F77, leave put not much work
* Seen ARPES definitions
* download.nexusformat.org/sphinx/                



Quo Vadis
=================

* The main focus of the NeXus community will be to 
  further develop the dictionary, base classes,
  application definitions
* The NIAC is a forum for resolving issues 
* The NIAC acts as a custodian for NeXus: definitions,
  examples, documentation, reference implementations
* NeXus can be mapped to different physical file 
  formats

   * HDF-5 is the preferred physical file format 
   * NeXus-XML is the currently supported ASCII 
     file format

* We recommended to use the NeXus hierarchy in 
  application definitions, but we do accept
  application definitions with a flattened
  hierarchy. 

Consequences 
=================

* The NAPI and applications are considered stable 
* The use of NAPI is not mandatory and examples 
  using HDF-5 APIs will be provided
* The validation tool is actively developed
* We seek cooperation with IUCR and CIF

  * Have a meeting with them to figure out what this
    means
  * May be have another NIAC next year to agree on this

* We encourage the inclusion of NeXus into CBFlib
* We invest into cleaning up NeXus, remove outdated,
  old or broken stuff
* We invest into documenting NeXus better through
  bringing inheritance or composition to NeXus base
  classes



Tasks for the Tech Committee
================================

* Cleanup NeXus
* Suggestion for an OO-NeXus




State of NeXus
===================

* Ask for representation!
* Who wants a standard, please seek contact 
* Validation valuable even without NeXus
