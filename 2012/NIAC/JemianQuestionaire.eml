Over the course of APS operations, APS has produced O(10^6) NeXus files.

APS has ~60 operating beam lines.  Apart from the areaDetector usage 
noted below, perhaps two or three instruments might be using NeXus.

Tough to answer how instruments might be using NeXus as usage is not 
coordinated by the facility.  The selection of a scientific data format 
is up to each instrument scientist who provides data reduction and 
analysis software.  EPICS software support for areaDetectors (as part of 
the data acquisition system) is the most common producer of NeXus files. 
  Out of 100 such detectors, perhaps 10-25% routinely produce NeXus/HDF5 
data files.

No major changes are anticipated

> * Barriers found for increasing NeXus use

* Education (too hard to learn how to use this)
* preconceived notions
   * looks too complex for my need
   * tried it years ago but it was inefficient for my needs
   * It's been here so long and not so many use it,
       so there must be something wrong with it
* organization of the NeXus hierarchy does not fit my problem
* too hard to read/write it
* implementing it brings no advantage to my instrument
* The NAPI has many dependencies,
     too hard to get it working on my machine

> * Priorities for the NeXus community should be

* Focus more on the class hierarchy
* Ensure that validation tools are available (conspicuous, even)
* the NAPI is a distraction to the data format
   * Few people use it as-is, even amongst the NIAC!
   * It uses precious volunteer labor resources
* Simplify, reduce the apparent complexity
* stop selling it so hard
* demonstrate its real use with science
* evaluate NeXus against its perceived advantages and revise
   * common format to convert between many
   * common data exchange format
   * common format analysis of data from many instruments
   * storage of raw instrument data
   * storage of reduced data for a scientific method

(To revise, evaluate the performance of NeXus in these areas and revise 
our expectations for a NeXus standard)
