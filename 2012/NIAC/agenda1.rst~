arrive on an opinion without to much pressure. If you have issues with this 
organisation, please speak up.

Of course, the list of topics to discuss at the NIAC meeting is still very open 
as is the agenda. If you want other topics discussed at the NIAC meeting, please 
let us know.

is also a good place to let us know additional topics for the NIAC meeting.
