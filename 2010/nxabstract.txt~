    NeXus for Neutrons

NeXus is a dataformat for neutron, X-ray and muSR scattering. NeXus is 
based on HDF-4, HDF-5 and XML as physical file formats. It adds to those 
file formats rules to organize data in the file and dictionaries of names 
to use which make sense for neutron scattering. An overview will be given 
on NeXus and  its recent developments.
