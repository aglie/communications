  Are the following statements true?

  The math involved is based on the augmented matrix notation as used in the 
  International Tables for Crystallography for describing space groups. A 
  matrix looks like this:

    r11 r12 r13 t1
    r21 r22 r23 t2
    r31 r32 r33 t3
      0   0   0  1

  with rij being the components of a 3x3 rotation matrix and the ti being components 
  of a translation vector. In CBFlib these matrices are stored as 4x3 matrices, leaving 
  the lower row out. Operations on these matrices are explicitly coded rather then using 
  a general purpose matrix package for matrix operations. 

  This also measn that at any given time, I have a choice: I can fold an operation into one 
  giving a rotation and an offset or I can use two transformation matrices: one for the rotation 
  and one for the translation.  

  How these matrices are constructed differs for translation and rotation axis:
  - For rotation axis the rij are calculated from the axis vector (direction) and the angle 
    setting. The offset of the axis is stored in the ti
  - For a translation axis, the rotation components are the 3x3 unit matrix. The ti are the 
    axis vector multipled with the axis setting plus the offset. 
  
  In order to establish the matrix for an individual axis you analyse the operation of the 
  axis at  the condition that all other settings are 0.  

  In order to describe the transformations for a piece of equipment depending on a number 
  of settings, the individual transformation matrices for each setting are multiplied together 
  in the order of the dependency chain. In order to understand one has to keep in mind that a 
  rotation also involves a rotation of the reference axis system. 


  Analyser Instrument
  -------------------

  Now, an example from neutron scattering: the analyser instrument. The geometry is as in this 
  ASCII drawing which hopefully transfers well:

          Analyzer
           /     \
          /       \
         /         \
        /           Detector
  Sample 
  

  Basically the primary beam hits the sample, the diffracted beam hits another crystal, the analyser, 
  before it gets counted in the detector. Is it correct to describe this setup with the following 
  quasi-CIF table?

  axis          dependson          vector        offset
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  2tana           .                0 1 0         0 0 0
  transana        2tana            0 0 1         0 0 0
  2tdet           transana         0 1 0         0 0 anadist
  dettrans        2tdet            0 0 1         0 0 anadist

  with transana having a value of anadist which is the sample - analyser distance and  detrans 
  having a value equivalent to the analyzer - detector distance. 

  If I have calculated such a combined transformation matrix, for example for the detector, then this 
  is a transfromation from the laboratory coordinate at the sample to a detector coordinate system. 
  This implies that multiplying 0,0,0 with the combined transformation matrix yields the absolute 
  position of the detector in the laboratory coordinate system.
